<h2>02.02 - The Stack</h2>
    <b>Stack</b> - collection of items; Last-in First-out --> elements are added and removed from only one end, they are 'stacked' on top of the last element. The top element (last stacked element), is then the first element removed.
        <strong>Constructor</strong>
        - 'new' = will create new stack

        <strong>Transfomers</strong>
        - 'push' = add element to top of stack
        - 'pop' = removes top element from stack

        <strong>Observer</strong>
        - 'top' = returns the top element of the stack; aka 'peek'

Given a string of the following characters:
(){}[]

Return whether the brackets are balanced.  That is, if for every closing bracket, there was an opening bracket before.

A balanced series: ({{[]()}})

A non-balanced series: ({}}))

Steps to Take:
Go through the string
Add every opening bracket to a stack
For every closing bracket, check to make sure the matching opening bracket is in the stack, then remove it
If the closing bracket doesn’t have a match in the stack, or if the stack is empty, then it isn’t balanced
