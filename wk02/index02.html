Given a string of the following characters:
(){}[]

Return whether the brackets are balanced.  That is, if for every closing bracket, there was an opening bracket before.

A balanced series: ({{[]()}})

A non-balanced series: ({}}))

Steps to Take:
Go through the string
Add every opening bracket to a stack
For every closing bracket, check to make sure the matching opening bracket is in the stack, then remove it
If the closing bracket doesn’t have a match in the stack, or if the stack is empty, then it isn’t balanced
