<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk 02 - Lesson 02 </h1>
<h2>02.01 - Generics</h2>
    ex: <strong>T</strong> type data; the data type is defined when the object is instantiated

<h2>02.02 - The Stack</h2>
    <strong>Stack</strong> - collection of items; Last-in First-out --> elements are added and removed from only one end, they are 'stacked' on top of the last element. The top element (last stacked element), is then the first element removed.
        <strong>Constructor</strong>
        - 'new' = will create new stack

        <strong>Transfomers</strong>
        - 'push' = add element to top of stack
        - 'pop' = removes top element from stack

        <strong>Observer</strong>
        - 'top' = returns the top element of the stack; aka 'peek'

<h3>02.02a - Building an Array Stack</h3>
        <strong>Stack Interfaces</strong> - methods / behaviors we expect from the stack
            - <em>push(T element)</em> - push item to stack, where t is data type and element is information to push
                can throw a StackOverflowException if stack is full

            - <em>pop()</em> - pops item from stack; 
                can throw StackUnderflowException if stack is empty

            - <em>top()</em> - aka: 'peek()' returns top element of stack without popping the item off 
                can throw StackUnderflowException if stack is empty

            - <em>boolean isFull()</em> - returns true if full, otherwise returns false

            - <em>boolean isEmpty</em> - returns true if empty, otherwise returns false

        ** Array stack is a generic and can accept any specified data type.

        can combine ex: <em>boolean push(Integer 156);</em>

        == Creating our own interface == 
            Interfaces define behavior of a class. It is does not give inheritance in the same way as 'extending' a class. 
            The define how we work with an object. 

            we create a 'cat' class: cat can walk; cat can meow; cat can eat -- 3 behaviors we assign to the cat

            classes do not inherit information from interface, the class 'implements' the interface to use the function

        <strong>Collection</strong> - is an object that holds other objects; Stacks are an example of a 'first in - last out'

<h2>02 - Summary</h2>

<h2>02 - Quiz</h2>
<strong>01) In the text we developed Java code for traversing a linked list. Here is a possibly flawed approach for
    using a traversal to print the contents of the linked list of strings accessed through letters. Indicate the
    description that best matches the code.</strong>
    <code>LLNode&gt;String&lt; currNode = letters;
        while (currNode != null)
        {
          currNode = currNode.getLink();
          System.out.println(currNode.getInfo());
        }</code>
    <em>Will bomb is list is not empty; <del>Very Good</del> <del>Correct, but inefficient</del></em>

<strong>02) We deal with ADTs on three levels. On which level do we just deal with the “what” questions, as in
    what does the ADT model do, what are its responsibilities, what is its interface?</strong>
    <em>Abstract / Logical</em>

<strong>03) Suppose we have a linked list of Strings, as defined in the text, named presidents. Suppose it
    contains three nodes, with the first node holding “Washington”, the second node “Adams”, and the third
    node “Jefferson”. What would be the result of the following code?</strong>
    <em>'Washington' is printed</em>
    
<strong>04) We deal with ADTs on three levels. On which level do we deal with the “how” questions, as in how do
    we represent the attributes and fulfill the responsibilities of the ADT?</strong>
    <em>Implementation (or concrete / internal)</em>

<strong>05) Stacks are useful in situations where:</strong>
    <em>?? ; <del>items are processed in the order they are encountered.</del></em>

<strong>06) If N represents the number of elements on the stack, then the isFull method of the
    ArrayBoundedStack class is O(N).</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>07) UML diagrams are a form of abstraction, since they hide details and allow us to concentrate just on
the major design components.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>08) The StackOverflowException is an unchecked exception.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>09) If N represents the maximum possible number of elements on the stack, then the LinkedStack
    constructor is O(N).</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>10) The following expression is balanced: ( ( xx [ {{ ** }} ] XX ) )</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>11) Which of the following statements is a legal declaration/instantiation of a Stack object based on the text
    code?</strong>
    <em>StackInterface stack = new ArrayBoundedStack (3); <del>StackInterface stack = new</del></em>

<strong>12) Starting with an empty stack, the sequence of operations push(1), push(2), pop(), push(3), leaves the
    stack, from top to bottom, as:</strong>
    <em>3, 1</em>

<strong>13) Starting with an empty stack the sequence of operations push(1), push(2), push(3), pop(), leaves the
    stack, from top to bottom, as:</strong>
    <em>2, 1</em>

<strong>14) Generics have been part of the Java language since it was first created.</strong>
    <em>False</em>


<h2>02 - Project</h2>
Given a string of the following characters:
(){}[]

Return whether the brackets are balanced.  That is, if for every closing bracket, there was an opening bracket before.

A balanced series: ({{[]()}})

A non-balanced series: ({}}))

Steps to Take:
Go through the string
Add every opening bracket to a stack
For every closing bracket, check to make sure the matching opening bracket is in the stack, then remove it
If the closing bracket doesn’t have a match in the stack, or if the stack is empty, then it isn’t balanced
