After watching the HackerRanks video, with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, and reading the book, I noticed some interesting differences in how they approach graph traversal. Gayleâ€™s video is very practical and hands-on, showing how to implement Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) with detailed coding examples. She uses recursion for DFS and a queue for BFS, which makes it easy to see how they work. The book, on the other hand, takes a more theoretical approach, treating traversal as a separate application and providing a flexible framework for graph operations.

The main thing with DFS is that it goes deep into one path before backtracking, making it great for exploring all possible paths. BFS, meanwhile, goes level by level, which is perfect for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. Both methods have their own perks, with DFS being ideal for puzzles and BFS for finding the quickest connections in things like network routing.
