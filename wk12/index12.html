<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk12 Ch10: The Graph ADT</h1>
<h2>10.01 - Graph Interface</h2>
    <strong>Graph</strong> - nodes that connect to other nodes, has edges and vertices
    <strong>Vertex</strong> - node of a graph
    <strong>Edge (arc)</strong> - Pair of vertices that represents a connection between 2 vertices in the graph
    <strong>Undirected Graph</strong> - edges have NO direction
    <strong>Directed Graph (Digraph)</strong> - graph in which edge is directed from 1 vertex to another

    <strong>Adjacent Vertices</strong> - 2 vertices (nodes) that are connected by an edge 
    <strong>Path</strong> - the sequence of vertices that connects 2 vertices in a graph (route from 1 node to another non-adjacent node)
    <strong>Complete Graph</strong> - each vertex is connected to each other vertex
    <strong>Weighted Graph</strong> - graph where each 'edge' carries a value, ex: the map with milage on edge between nodes

<h2>10.02 - Implementations of Graphs</h2>
    <strong>Array-Based implementation</strong> - int for # of vertices, array for the vertices, and 2-D array for edges

    <strong>Linked Implementation</strong> - each node points to link list

    -- Depth-First = use stack, goes deeper before wider
    -- Breadth First (level-by-level) = use queue, goes wide before deep


<h2>10.03 - Graph Traversals</h2>
