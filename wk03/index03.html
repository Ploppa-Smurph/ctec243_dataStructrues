<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk03 Linked Lists, Stacks, & Queues</h1>
<h2>03.01: Linked Lists</h2>
    - can contain any type of data
    - can be sorted / unsorted
    - can contain duplicates

    * slower than an array because you have to start at the 'head' (beginning of list) everytime you go through the list. 

    ++ insertion and deletion of elements is quick when 'prepending' -- working on the first element - this is constant time and is fast. O(1)
          -- negative insertion / deletion of elements at the end of the list take (linear time) -- this is linear time and slow. O(n)

    <strong>Doubly Linked List</strong> -- links to next element in list, also to previous element in the list.

<h2>03.02: Stacks and Queues</h2>
    - both linear data structures
    - flexible size

    <strong>Stack</strong> - LIFO (Last in First Out)
        needs an inner Node class

    <strong>Queue</strong> - FIFO (First in First Out)
        needs an inner Node class 
        Queue will add to the tail & remove from the head

        boolean isEmpty() {
            return head == null;        
        }

        int peek() {
            return head.data;    
        }

        void add(int data) {
            Node node = new Node(data);
            if (tail != null) {
                tail.next = node;
            }
            tail = node;
            if (head == null) {
                head = node;
            }
        }

        int remove() {
            int data = head.data;
            head = head.next;
            if (head == null) {
                tail = null;
                }
            }
            return data;
