<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk03 Linked Lists, Stacks, & Queues</h1>
<h2>03.01: Linked Lists</h2>
    - can contain any type of data
    - can be sorted / unsorted
    - can contain duplicates

    * slower than an array because you have to start at the 'head' (beginning of list) everytime you go through the list. 

    ++ insertion and deletion of elements is quick when 'prepending' -- working on the first element - this is constant time and is fast. O(1)
          -- negative insertion / deletion of elements at the end of the list take (linear time) -- this is linear time and slow. O(n)

    <strong>Doubly Linked List</strong> -- links to next element in list, also to previous element in the list.

<h2>03.02: Stacks and Queues</h2>
    - both linear data structures
    - flexible size

    <strong>Stack</strong> - LIFO (Last in First Out)
        needs an inner Node class

    <strong>Queue</strong> - FIFO (First in First Out)
        needs an inner Node class 
        Queue will add to the tail & remove from the head

        boolean isEmpty() {
            return head == null;        
        }

        int peek() {
            return head.data;    
        }

        void add(int data) {
            Node node = new Node(data);
            if (tail != null) {
                tail.next = node;
            }
            tail = node;
            if (head == null) {
                head = node;
            }
        }

        int remove() {
            int data = head.data;
            head = head.next;
            if (head == null) {
                tail = null;
                }
            }
            return data;

<h2>Proj 03: Palindrome Detector (Stacks)</h2>
Using a stack, build a palindrome detector.

A palindrome is any word or sequence of words that reads the same forwards or backwards.  Some examples:

Racecar
Tacocat
A man a plan a canal Panama
Build a program that tests multiple Strings and lets the user know whether or not they are palindromes.  Your program should "sanitize" the input so that capitalization and spacing should not matter (that is, "Taco Cat" would still be a palindrome, even though the direct reverse is "taC ocaT").  Your program must also use a Stack to solve the problem.

Your program should test the following Strings:

Racecar (is a palindrome)
Tacocat (is a palindrome)
A man a plan a canal Panama (is a palindrome)
This is not a palindrome (is not a palindrome)
Hints:

There are multiple String methods that can help you sanitize your input and help build your stack.  Look over the methods here:

To sanitize your string, remember that capitalization shouldn't matter, so there's no harm if you change whether your string is in upper case or lower case
To sanitize your string, you can also replace the spaces in it with nothing ("")
Think about putting each letter in your string in a stack.  What order would they come back out?  Could you compare that version to the original?
You can (and probably should) use the Java Stack implementation.  You don't have to use the book's or your own Stack implementation
