<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk 08: The List ADT</h1>
<h2>06.01 - List Data Structure and Iterables</h2>
    <strong>there is a 'linear' relationship to the elements of a collection. it is the same as the collection, but with </strong>
        - elements of the list are indexed sequentially from zero to one less than the size of the list.
            - must define methods for adding, retrieving, changing, and removing elements from index, as well as method for determining index of element
            - must handle 'IndexOutOfBoundsException' if the index is invalid.

        - makes use of Java Iterable method, <em>iterator</em> that creates and return an Iterator object
        - Factory Methdod: method that creates and returns objects
        - <em>Iterator</em> object provides 3 operations: 
            - <em>hasNext</em>
            - <em>next</em>
            - <em>remove</em>

        - Array-based list - slow at removal and insertion, quick at reading a specifc index
        - LinkList-based   - fast at removal and insertion, slow at reading from specific index

        - the Iterator class has an anonymous inner class, the Anonymous class has no name, it is simply instantiated where needed
        - the Abstract class is built inside the Iterator object, and uses an anonymous class
            - iterator has hasNext(), and must utilize hasNext() before using next()
            - next() method
            - remove() method, must then shift all remaining element back 1 space -- this is O(N) complexity and is time consuming
