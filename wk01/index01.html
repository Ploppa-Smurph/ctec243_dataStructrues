    <i>
             Object orientation allows developers to organize their solutions around models of re-
        ality, accruing benefits of understandability, reusability, and maintainability. The primary
        construct for creating systems using this approach is the class. Classes are used to create
        objects that work together to provide solutions to problems. Java’s inheritance mecha-
        nism and package construct help us organize our classes.
             Java’s exception handling mechanisms provide a powerful way to organize our sys-
        tem’s responses to special situations. We can choose to handle exceptional situations
        where they are first encountered or to throw the responsibility out to another level. A
        good understanding of this mechanism is a crucial ingredient for creating safe, reliable
        systems.
             Programs operate on data, so how the data are organized is of prime importance. Data
        structures deal with this organization. Several classic organizational structures have been
        identified through the years to help programmers create correct and efficient solutions
        to problems. The Java language provides basic structuring mechanisms for creating these
        structures—namely, the array and the reference mechanisms. Order of growth notation
        is an approach for classifying the efficiency of the algorithms that we will employ when
        implementing and using our data structures.
             Programmers are problem solvers. Object orientation allows seamless integration of
        problem analysis and design, resulting in problem solutions that are maintainable and
        reusable. Data structures provide ways of organizing the data of the problem domain so
        that solutions are correct and efficient. Staying organized is the key to solving difficult
        problems!

<h3>01 - Project</h3>
- Create a program that simulates a small part of a Baseball game.  You should have a Pitcher who throws a Ball to a Batter, who will swing at the Ball either hitting it or striking out.

Your program should have a main class to test everything.  You should create a Pitcher and a Batter, then simulate three pitches and display whether they were hit or if they were missed.

Planning:
Ball
Create a Ball class that contains basic information on how fast it's travelling and where it currently is
Pitcher
Create a Pitcher class that can "throw" a Ball (meaning the pitcher should be able to add speed and direction to the ball).
It's okay if your Pitcher is able to conjure new Balls out of thin air at will
When your Pitcher throws a ball, they should throw it at a random speed within a specified range (the range can be whatever makes sense to you)
Batter
Create a Batter class who tries to "hit" the ball
The Batter needs a way to receive a ball from the Pitcher
To hit the ball, the batter should generate a random “speed check” number.  If the ball is going the speed check speed or slower, then the Batter successfully hits the ball.  If not, then the batter misses it.
Assume the Batter will hit the ball at the exact same speed as it is thrown.  This is a wacky game of baseball.
Main
In your base class in the main method, create a Pitcher and a Batter and simulate a number of tosses entered in by the user at run time, reporting the results to the console.
