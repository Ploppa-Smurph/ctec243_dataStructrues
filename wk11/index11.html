<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk11 Ch 09: The Priority Queue ADT</h1>   
<h2>09.01 - Priority Queue and Heap</h2>
    <strong>Priority Queue</strong> is an abstract data type with and interesting accessing protocol - only highest-priority element can be accessed
        ** useful fo application that processes items by priority

    Priority Queue Interface
    <strong>enqueue</strong>
    <strong>dequeue</strong>
    <strong>isEmpty</strong>
    <strong>isFull</strong>
    <strong>size</strong>

    Priority Queue Implementations
    <strong>Unsorted List</strong> - dequeue requires search through entire list
    <strong>Array Based-Sorted List</strong> - enqueue expensive
    <strong>Sorted Linked List</strong> - enquees at O(N)
    <strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> - averages O(logN) for enqueue and dequeue 
    <strong>Heap</strong> - gurantees O(logN), even in worst case

    <strong>Heap</strong> - is an implementation of a Priority Queue that uses a 'binary tree' (not Binary Search Tree) and satisfies 2 properties:
        - <em><strong>Shape property</strong></em> - the tree must be a complete binary tree
        - <em><strong>Order property</strong></em> - for every node in the tree, the value stored in that node is greater than or equal to the value in each of its children
            -- there are 'minHeap' and 'maxHeap'

    <strong>Complete</strong> binary tree - 
    <strong>Full</strong> binary tree - is totally full, ends up being somewhat triangular in layout because parent is small and it works down from left to right filling in the children, and acendents
        ex:
        <em>o</em> = full and complete

<h2>09 - Review</h2>
<strong>01) True or False?  A Priority Queue supports FIFO access</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>02) True or False? Suppose a (max) heap consists of the elements 1, 5, 7, 9, 10. Then the root of the heap "tree" is 10.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>03) True or False? Suppose a heap consists of the elements 1, 5, 7, 9, 10. Then the underlying tree is full.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>04) True or False? All heaps with 10 elements have the same "shape."</strong>
    <em></em>

<strong>05) True or False?  You can implement a priority queue using a linked list.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>06) True or False?  A precondition of the reheapUp operation is that the last index position of the tree is empty.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>07) True or False?  Using a sorted linked list (sorted in reverse order) to implement a priority queue would require an O(N) dequeue operation (where N is the number of elements in the  priority queue).</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>08) True or False?  A precondition of the reheapUp operation is that the root of the tree is empty.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>09) True or False?  Using a sorted linked list to implement a priority queue would require an O(N) enqueue operation (where N is the number of elements in the priority queue).</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>10) True or False? Suppose a heap consists of the elements 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 19. Then the underlying tree is full.</strong>
    <em>True</em>

<strong>11) True or False? The underlying tree of a heap is a binary search tree</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>12) True or False?  A precondition of the reheapDown operation is that the last index position of the tree is empty.</strong>
    <em>False</em>

<strong>13) True or False?  Using a sorted linked list to implement a priority queue would allow an O(1) enqueue operation.</strong>
    <em>False</em>
