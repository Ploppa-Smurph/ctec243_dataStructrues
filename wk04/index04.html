<h1>CTEC 243 Data Structures wk04: Recursion</h1>
<h2>03.01 - Recursion</h2>
    ** can be slower and less-efficient than imperative solution
     + can be easier to read than a longer more detailed imperative solution
     - recursion can result in overflow (stack overflow) as it adds more and more items to the stack

    <strong>Recursion Depth</strong> - how many times the method calls itself
    <strong>Base Case</strong> - scenario which the problem can be solved without recursion 
    <strong>Recursive Case</strong> - a scenario you can use recursion to solve 
    <strong>Direct Recursion</strong> - recursion in which a method directly calls itself
    <strong>Indirect Recursion</strong> - recursion in which a chain of 2 or more method calls returns to the method that originated the chain. 
        <em>ex: 'method A' calls 'method B' which in turn calls 'method A'</em>

    <strong>3 Questions in Recursion</strong>
        <em>Base-Case Question</em> - is there a non-recursive way out?
        <em>Smaller-Caller Question</em> - does every recursive call move towards the Base-Case?
        <em>General-Case Question</em> - does it do what you want it to?

    <strong><em>ex: Factorials</em></strong>
        n! -- if you see a number, or 'n' with and ! next to it that is a factorial
            <em>factorials - you take the number and multiply it by every number up until and including itself</em>
            <em>ex: 6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6</em>

            <em>0! = 1</em> -- that is a math rule
